# A Note on CLI Extensibility

There are two scenarios where we want to extend your CLI:

-   You have a base CLI definition and want to define a third-party CLI that reuses the base CLI commands.
-   You have a base CLI definition that itself should be extensible with third-party CLI definitions.

The definition of extension is slightly different for each case.
